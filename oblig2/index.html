        <p class="lefties">Welcome to the world of 'Miscellaneous Items in High Demand' - and more</p>
        <p id="artAuthor" class="lefties">BY ELIZA MCGRAW</p>
        <p class="lefties"><a id="capitalI" class="lefties">I</a>forage regularly through the online images in
            the Library of Congress's Prints & Photographs
            Division, and sometimes I come across a
            picture - construction equipment at the U.S.
            Treasury building, tennis players on a bridge, a
            poster advertising catsup - categorized with the
            evocative label "Miscellaneous Items in High
            Demand."" That sounds like one of the world's most
            interesting collections of miscellany; I wondered how it
            worked.
            <br>
            So I went to the Prints & Photographs Division
            reading room in the library's Madison Building, where
            rows of wide maroon file cabinets hold troves of
            material. A corkboard wall displayed book covers that
            feature photographs from the library, on topics as
            varied as baseball and architect Eero Saarinen. The
            division holds more than 16 million images (on- and
            off-site) of just about anything conceivable: courtroom
            sketches and comic drawings along with lithographs,
            fine prints, Dorothea Lange's "Migrant Mother"
            photograph, and a daguerreotype of Abraham Lincoln.
            About 1.6 million are digitized.
            <br>
            As it turns out, Miscellaneous Items in High
            Demand is not actually a collection, at least not in the
            way I'd imagined (i.e., a sturdy box, with a happily</p>

                130,000 images. The items sorted into this category lacked a spot in
                another specific collection. They were requested and pulled for use
                in a book, for example, or an exhibition - hence the "high demand."

                Researchers access the Prints & Photographs Division for many
                reasons, division reference librarian Hanna Soltys told me,
                including schoolwork or publishing, or because they want to print
                and hang a favorite picture. Seated at a computer, Soltys pulled up a
                grid layout of images. "The beauty of Miscellaneous Items in High
                Demand is really kind of this, I think," she said, "being able to click </p>

        <p id="leftText">the 'View All'. ... You scroll through and
            there's no rhyme or reason why images are
            appearing in here. It's solely because it
            appeared somewhere, or somebody bought
            a copy of it, or it was used in an exhibition
            and so it's appearing in this bucket."
            "I'm usually looking for something
            specific and then one of the hits might come
            from that category," professional researcher
            Athena Angelos says. She owns (and is)
            Pictorial Research Services of Washington,
            D.C. "Say you were doing something about
            George Washington 4 you find there9s
            some image of an illustration of him
            chopping down the cherry tree and that9s
            from Miscellaneous High Demand." From
            a specific image page, she might move on to
            browse others as well. "It branches out," she
            says.
            <br>
            Images that a user might be seeking are
            often also available in the library's more
            frequently updated Free to Use and Reuse
            Sets. (Topics include ice cream, natural
            disasters, fish and fishing, motion picture
            theaters and hats.) To maximize results,
            people can search across all collections. For
            example, my recent search for "circus horse"
            turned up 62 results in Miscellaneous Items
            in High Demand. But a search of the entire
            online catalogue revealed 168 results, and if
            you try “circus posters,” which often include
            horses, you will get 584 hits. In the reading
            room, Soltys had laid out a few of the
            images from that expanded search: a circa
            1909 photograph of an “educated horse”
            looking at a blackboard, and one of a
            performer and her sturdy dapple gray.
            Others included a photograph of a Barnum
            & Bailey representative at a horse auction,
            and a stereograph of Piccadilly Circus in
            London, in which a horse-drawn carriage
            advertises an animal feed called Molassine
            Meal.
            <br>
            Similar discoveries can occur when
            searching inside the reading room, where
            some original items are stored. Soltys
            tugged on a file-cabinet drawer that glided
            open with a satisfying whoosh, and expertly
            cruised through photographs stored in
            protective sleeves. Separators bore labels:
            carnivals, motor parks, livestock shows.
            To sift through the drawers, Soltys says,
            “you don't have to come in and tell us what
            you're doing; you don't have to get
            permission to come in.” Anyone with a
            reader registration card may have a
            look. But if you need something specific,
            Soltys advises, make contact ahead of
            time, in case, for example, the material you
            seek is stored off-site or is too fragile to
            handle.
